# Loan Review AI Agent

An intelligent AI agent built with OpenAI's GPT-4 API that analyzes loan application data and answers questions about loan applicants using natural language processing.

## 📋 Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an AI agent that can understand and analyze structured loan data. The agent uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model to provide intelligent responses to questions about loan applicants, their demographics, income, and loan approval status.

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive CLI Interface**: Ask questions about loan data in natural language
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses GPT-4 to understand and analyze loan application data
- **Data Context Awareness**: Provides the AI with dataset structure and metadata
- **Real-time Responses**: Get instant answers to your queries about loan applicants

## 📊 Dataset

The `loan_prediction.csv` file contains loan application data with the following columns:

- **Loan_ID**: Unique identifier for each loan application
- **Gender**: Applicant's gender (Male/Female)
- **Married**: Marital status (Yes/No)
- **Dependents**: Number of dependents (0, 1, 2, 3+)
- **Education**: Education level (Graduate/Not Graduate)
- **Self_Employed**: Employment status (Yes/No)
- **ApplicantIncome**: Primary applicant's income
- **CoapplicantIncome**: Co-applicant's income
- **LoanAmount**: Requested loan amount
- **Loan_Amount_Term**: Loan term in months
- **Credit_History**: Credit history status (0/1)
- **Property_Area**: Property location (Urban/Semiurban/Rural)
- **Loan_Status**: Loan approval status (Y/N)

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   cd "Building_an_AI_Agent_using_OpenAI _API"
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure your API credentials:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Then edit `.env` with your actual credentials:
   
   **For OpenAI:**
   - Set `USE_AZURE_OPENAI=false`
   - Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   
   **For Azure OpenAI:**
   - Set `USE_AZURE_OPENAI=true`
   - Add your `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, and `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`

## 💻 Usage

Run the application:
```bash
python loan_prediction.py
```

### Example Queries

Once the agent is running, you can ask questions like:

- "How many loan applications are in the dataset?"
- "What is the average income of applicants?"
- "How many loans were approved vs rejected?"
- "What is the typical loan amount requested?"
- "How many applicants have a graduate degree?"
- "What percentage of self-employed applicants got approved?"

Type `exit` to quit the application.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Data Loading**: The application reads the loan prediction CSV file using pandas
2. **Data Summarization**: Creates a summary of the dataset structure (rows, columns, data types)
3. **AI Processing**: Sends user queries along with dataset context to GPT-4
4. **Response Generation**: GPT-4 analyzes the query and provides intelligent answers
5. **Interactive Loop**: Continues to accept and process queries until the user exits

## 📦 Dependencies

- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **openai**: OpenAI API client for GPT-4 integration
- **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management

## 🔑 API Configuration

The agent supports both **OpenAI** and **Azure OpenAI** services.

### OpenAI Configuration
- **Model**: gpt-4 (configurable via `OPENAI_MODEL`)
- **Authentication**: API Key

### Azure OpenAI Configuration
- **Model**: Configurable deployment name
- **API Version**: 2024-02-15-preview (default)
- **Authentication**: API Key + Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: Your Azure OpenAI resource endpoint

### Model Parameters
- **Temperature**: 0.2 (for more focused, deterministic responses)
- **Max Tokens**: 500 (controls response length)

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Data Exploration**: Quickly understand loan application patterns
- **Business Intelligence**: Get insights from loan data without writing SQL queries
- **Decision Support**: Analyze factors affecting loan approvals
- **Educational**: Learn about AI agents and natural language interfaces

## 📝 Notes

- The AI agent provides insights based on the dataset summary, not direct data analysis
- For production use, consider implementing actual pandas operations for precise calculations
- Ensure your OpenAI API key has sufficient credits before running the application
- The agent's responses are generated by GPT-4 and may occasionally require clarification

## 🔒 Security

- Never commit your `.env` file or expose your OpenAI API key
- Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file
- Use environment variables for sensitive information
